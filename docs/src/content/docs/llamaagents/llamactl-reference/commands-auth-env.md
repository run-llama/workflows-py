Manage environments (distinct control plane API URLs). Environments determine which profiles are shown and where auth/project actions apply.

## Usage

```bash
llamactl auth env [COMMAND] [options]
```

Commands:

- `list`: List known environments and mark the current one
- `add <API_URL> [--interactive/--no-interactive]`: Probe the server and upsert the environment
- `switch [API_URL] [--interactive/--no-interactive]`: Select the current environment (prompts if omitted)
- `delete [API_URL] [--interactive/--no-interactive]`: Remove an environment and its associated profiles

Notes:

- Probing reads `requires_auth` and `min_llamactl_version` from the server version endpoint.
- Switching environment filters profiles shown by `llamactl auth list` and used by other commands.

## Commands

### List

```bash
llamactl auth env list
```

Shows a table of environments with API URL, whether auth is required, and the current marker.

### Add

```bash
llamactl auth env add <API_URL>
```

Probes the server at `<API_URL>` and stores discovered settings. Interactive mode can prompt for the URL.

### Switch

```bash
llamactl auth env switch [API_URL]
```

Sets the current environment. If omitted in interactive mode, youâ€™ll be prompted to select one.

### Delete

```bash
llamactl auth env delete [API_URL]
```

Deletes an environment and all associated profiles. If the deleted environment was current, the current environment is reset to the default.
