"""
Commands returned by the control loop's tick reducer.

The control loop follows a reducer pattern:
  1. Wait for a tick (event, step result, timeout, etc.)
  2. Reduce the tick with current state -> (new_state, commands)
  3. Execute commands (which may spawn async tasks or queue new ticks)
  4. Repeat

Commands represent imperative actions to take after processing a tick,
such as starting workers, queuing events, or completing the workflow.
